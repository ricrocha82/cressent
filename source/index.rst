CRESSENT Tutorial: Complete Analysis Pipeline
====================================================

Hi there and welcome to the CRESSENT documentation webpage. 

Here you will find examples of the tool capabilities and how you can use it to improve annotation of the ssDNA sequences.

Overview
======================
CRESSENT (CRESS DNA Virus Analysis Tool) is a comprehensive bioinformatics pipeline designed for the analysis of ssDNA viruses. This tutorial will guide you through the complete workflow, from basic sequence processing to advanced phylogenetic analysis.


Installation
==================

To install the tool is simple. Go to the `Github page <https://github.com/ricrocha82/cressent?tab=readme-ov-file#install>` and follow the instrucitons.

After installation, activate the CRESSENT conda environment:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda activate cressent


Ok. If everything is working fine, we can start digging into the ssDNA sequences. 

To start with the tutorial we are going to use sequences from two studies:

Genomoaviridae genomes from `Dai et al <https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-6208723/v1>`_

Naryaviridae genomes from `Leal Rodr√≠guez et al <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-023-02685-x>`_
